# Identify Solid Waste Collection Date by Address
This Python Tool is published as a Geoprocessing Service on ArcGIS Server. Once published, a request can be
made to the REST endpoint with the address in question. The results of the request are then published as a table,
letting the end user know their garbage and recycling collection dates.
